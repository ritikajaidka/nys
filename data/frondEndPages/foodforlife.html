            Food is the first and most important element for living. Providing nutritious food to the needy is a great service to humanity. 
            HKFFL, Udhampur emphasize the importance of providing healthy, hygienic and nutritious food. Udhampur is a small town in the hills 
            of J & K. Nearby areas are very poor and people can hardly get any nutritious food. During our free medical camps, realizing this fact,
             Chairman of the trust, H.H. Nava Yogendra swami ji Maharaj decided and announced that we would provide free nutritious meals for 
             everyone (including patients, their relatives and mass public) after each camp. To alleviate any disease, only medication is not 
             enough. A healthy nutritious diet is also necessary. In fact, some diseases can be cured by a healthy diet alone.

Keeping these points in mind, HKFFL Udhampur organizes regular Food for Life programs for the benefit of the masses.

At Srila Prabhupada ashram, Udhampur  about 300 people take meals, daily.On Sundays this number increases to as much as 1000.

Besides this other food for life program organized by HKFFL Udhampur are as follow:- </br>

Food distributed at earthquake relief in 2005 at POK – 1000 people </br>
At Allahabad Kumbh Mela 2007 – 25,000 people </br>
At Haridwar Kumbh Mela 2010 – 10,000 people </br>
During Free Medical Camps – 7,000 people </br>
During Purushottam month bhandara 2012 – 30,000 people </br>
