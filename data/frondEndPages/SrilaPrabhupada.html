            His Divine Grace Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Prabhupāda
 
          </h3>
          <p class="step-description">
            Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, the guru of Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, appeared in Sri Ksetra Dhama.
            (Jagannatha Puri) on 6 February 1874 as the son of Srila Sacidananda Bhaktivinoda Thakura. In his childhood he quickly mastered 
            the Vedas, memorized the Bhdgavad-gita, and relished his father's philosophical works. He became known as "The Living Encyclopedia" 
            for his vast knowledge. <br />
 
   He preached convincingly against casteism and philosophical deviations from Gaudiya Vaisnavism. He tried to unite the four Vaisnava 
   sampradayas by publishing their teachings. Srila Sarasvati Thakura earned the title Nrisimha Guru for his fearless and powerful delivery 
   of the Vaisnava siddhanta. Mayavadis would cross the street to avoid confronting the "lion guru." Besides being a courageous preacher, 
   he was ornamented with all divine qualities and full of ecstatic love of God.

            First Meeting with his gurudev
          </h3>
          <p class="step-description">
            Born Abhay Charan De on September 1, 1896, in Calcutta, as a young man he became involved with Mahatma Gandhi’s civil disobedience
             movement. It was, however, a meeting with a prominent scholar and spiritual leader, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, which proved 
             most influential on young Abhay’s future calling. At their first meeting Srila Bhaktisiddhanta asked Abhay to bring the teachings 
             of Krishna to the English-speaking world. Deeply moved by Srila Bhaktisiddhanta’s devotion and wisdom, Abhay became his student
              and dedicated himself to carrying out his mentor’s request. But it wasn’t until 1965, at the age of seventy, that he would set
               off on his mission to the West.

            Preaching all around the world 
          </h3>
          <p class="step-description">
            In these eleven years, Srila Prabhupada circled the globe twelve times, bringing the teachings of Bhakti to thousands 
            of people on six continents. Men and women from all backgrounds came forward to understand his message. With their help, 
            Srila Prabhupada established centres and projects throughout the world including temples, self-sustainable communities,
             educational institutions, and what would become the world’s largest vegetarian food relief program. With the desire to
              nourish the roots of Bhakti in its homeland, Srila Prabhupada returned to India several times, where he sparked its revival. 
              In India, he opened dozens of temples, including important centres in the holy towns of Vrindavan and Mayapur.
