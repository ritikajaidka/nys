                    <h2> Birth and Parents</h2>
                        

                    <div><p class="text-white-75 mb-4">He was born on 12th May 1946 on the very auspicious day 
                        of Rukmani Dwadashi in the holy town of Udhampur (J&K). He hails from a royal family 
                        of Raj Purohits (family Brahmin priests of the king of Kashmir). His father Pandit 
                        Harichandra Ji and mother Smt. Durga Devi both were ardent devotees of Lord Krishna.</p>
                    </div>

                    
                    <h2>Childhood and Graduation</h2>
                        

                    <div><p class="text-white-75 mb-4">Maharaj Ji is a naishtik brahmachari (celibate since birth). It is a common saying 
                        “Morning shows the day”. Since his childhood his holiness exhibited Divine qualities of a saint and observed four 
                        regulative principles naturally. At the tender age of 9 years his holiness after seeing a movie “Dhruva Maharaj” 
                        left his home and proceeded towards the forest just to darshan of the Lord Krishna in person.</p>

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">But after spending a day in a temple, on the advice of some sadhus he came back to his home. Again at the age of 
                        17, he left his home and stayed for some time in the holy dham of Vrindavan in the association of many sadhus. 
                        Maharaj Ji had to come back to Udhampur because his parents had located him in Sri Vrindavan Dham. His desire for 
                        Krishna Bhakti grew day by day along with his disinterest in the material life. After completing his graduation he 
                        could not keep himself any longer in a material association and he left Udhampur.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>First meeting with Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada and Diksha</h2>
                        

                    <div><p class="text-white-75 mb-4">He came to Delhi where one day in a marketplace he was quite impressed to see some 
                        foreign devotees distributing Krishna books. He followed them and reached the Hare Krishna temple at Palam. Next 
                        day by the Divine arrangement of Krishna he left for Vrindavan and finally reached in the Divine association of His 
                        Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Srila Prabhupada.</p>

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">It was in the year 1974 when his holiness got initiation from His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, 
                        the founder Acharya of Great ISKCON and formally became his disciple. Seeing the dedication, sincerity, renunciation 
                        and pure devotion in him, Srila Prabhupada awarded him the renounced (Sannyas diksha) at the young age of 28. After 
                        taking Sannyas, His Holiness Nava Yogendra Swami Ji traveled around the world over a dozen times for preaching purposes.</p>
                    </div>




                    <h2>Preaching and Following Srila Prabhupada’s instructions</h2>
                        

                    <div><p class="text-white-75 mb-4">For seven years he lived a hectic and austere life even refraining from sugar, salt and grains in his food. 
                        He twice got the wonderful opportunity to serve Srila Prabhupada as a personal servant.</p>

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">Carrying out the order of Srila Prabhupada with extreme vigour Maharaj is still preaching strongly all 
                            over the world till date. Maharaj Ji is expert in explaining Vedic Philosophy to the masses in Hindi, English, Urdu, Dogri, Punjabi, 
                            Gujrati and few African languages too. He preaches the teachings of Lord Chaitanya through simple discourses and melodies bhajans in 
                            the same way as the great vaishnavas like Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur, Srila Narrotama Das Thakur, Srila Lochana das Thakur did, which 
                            is easily understood and followed by common masses. His spiritual discourses and vibrant sankirtan enlivens the crowd to such as extent 
                            that they just can’t stop themselves from dancing and singing. Maharaj Ji never believes in narrow communism. Besides Srimad Bhagvad 
                            Gita and Srimad Bhagvatam he also gives references from the Guru Granth Saheb, Holy Bible, Holy Koran etc. in his spiritual discourses.</p>
                        
                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">Maharaj ji believes in strong discipline. He gives utmost importance to cleanliness, purity, truthfulness and 
                            punctuality. This is evident from his extraordinary personal activities. He takes his meals only once in 24 hours. His day starts at 
                            2 A.M and he goes on preaching till mid night. He is very loving and affectionate with people and helps them solve their problems. 
                            He has lectured at several universities in India and abroad. He has never been seen wearing any warm clothes and shoes apart from 
                            the usual three clothes and wooden slippers of a sannyasi even in chilly winter. He is very particular about the spiritual progress 
                            of each and every soul especially his disciples and personally see to it the they are following strictly the four regulative principles 
                            (no tea-coffee-intoxication, no meat-onion-garlic eating, no illicit-sex, no gambling, no mental speculation) and strongly advocates 
                            for getting early in Mangal Aarti.</p>
                        
                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">For the sake of preaching, Maharaj Ji is always on the move travelling most of the time. He has been 
                            visiting and preaching Krishna consciousness several times in most of the countries across the globe. He has preached about 
                            Srimad Bhagvat Gita to many leaders and presidents of various countries. He developed/established/constructed temples and 
                            preaching centres, Gurukuls, Goshalas, widow & orphan homes at Africa, England, America, Chandigarh, Vrindavana, Haridwar, 
                            Udhampur, Katra, Lucknow, Amritsar, Maharashtra etc. He is also organizing rathyatras and inspiring thousands and thousands 
                            of people across the globe to surrender to the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada and get the mercy of Lord Chaitanya.</p>
